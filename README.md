# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Pretty self-explanatory...


## How to play

Clone the repository to your local machine. Or just download... it's one file...

Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

Run the script using Python (Python 3 required).

Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your choice of "rock", "paper", or "scissors".

The computer will select its action randomly. 

The game will keep going until you win 3 rounds in a row.

## Game Rules

## Final notes

Thank you for giving me a minute of your time.
